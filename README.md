# hello-world
Married, father of two.  I have spent most of the past 20 years earning a living by programming in OpenEdge.  Most of that time, I have further specialized in customizing the software product known as QAD.  I have had some adventures in Business Intelligence.  

As time permits, I sculpt Christmas frogs out of polymer clay. Or jog. Or do weights. Or go to Toastmasters.

These days? I also job hunt.
